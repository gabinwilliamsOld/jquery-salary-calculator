# Project Name

jQUERY-SALARY-CALCULATOR

## Description
The following was used in the project: html, css, bootStrap, javaScript, jQuery

The following project is used to input employee data, store and display the data, and calculate a monthly cost of operation in the scope of employee salaries.

I decided to store the employee data in an object and then store that object in another object to create a unique identifier I would be able to call from the appended html code, as well as make it easier to delete/clear the object after the delete button was clicked.

The project was a great learning experience and I walked away with a better understanding of certain methods I have never used before!
